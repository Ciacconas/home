# Arch Home

This is a backup of my home folder on Arch Linux. By default nothing is added to this folder because the `.gitignore` contains a single `*`: it will ignore everything added to the folder. Only while explicitly adding (with the `-f` flag) and commiting a file to the repository, it will be tracked.
