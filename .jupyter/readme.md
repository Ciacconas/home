# .jupyter

Jupyter configuration. Jupyter is a programming notebook server.

In this folder you also find configuration files, service files and nginx files
for jupyterhub. I have jupyterhub always running on port 8000. This removes the
extra step of having to start the server before opening a jupyter notebook.
