# Arch Home

This is a backup of my home folder on Arch Linux. By default nothing is added to this folder because the `.gitignore` contains a single `*`: it will ignore everything added to the folder. Only while explicitly adding (with the `-f` flag) and commiting a file to the repository, it will be tracked.

## Contents
* [.first_install](#first-install-folder-[`.first_install`]) [folder]


## First Install Folder [[`.first_install`](.first_install)]

Contains all files necessary to do a proper first installation of Arch Linux. It contains a readme file [`readme.md`](.first_install/readme.md) containing all the manual installation steps needed to be taken to make a proper Arch Linux installation.

It also contains an installation bash script [`first_install.sh`](.first_install/first_install.sh) which installs the essential programs for the new installation automatically.
