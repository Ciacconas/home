# qutebrowser

qutebrowser is a browser with vim-like navigation. It works really well, but is
unfortunately quite slow.


## Alternative:
A better alternative (the one I actually use), is to use Firefox + VimFx.
However, since VimFx is a legacy firefox extension, you'll need the
[LegacyFox](https://github.com/girst/LegacyFox) patch for newer firefox browsers.
