# fontconfig

Default fonts and font settings can be configured in [fonts.conf](fonts.conf).

Configuring fontconfig is a real pain. I completely don't understand
how it works. The only thing that reliably works for me for all
applications is blocking fonts, hence why I have so many fonts blocked
in [conf.d](conf.d).
