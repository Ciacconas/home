# nvim
Neovim, also known as `nvim`, or just `vim` is a versatile text editor.
My neovim config is in constant flux and is pretty much a perpetual work-in-progress.

* My [init.vim](init.vim) contains the bulk of the configuration
* Often used snippets are found in [snippets/](snippets/)
* A custom colorscheme using exclusively Xresources colors can be found in [colors/](colors/).
* A custom airline theme using exclusively Xresources colors can be found in
  [autoload/airline/themes/](autoload/airline/themes/)
