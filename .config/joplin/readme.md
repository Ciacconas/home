# joplin
Settings for the joplin terminal client. Joplin is a note-taking app akin to Evernote.

## Tip:
Configure joplin how you like it in the GUI client, `joplin-desktop`. Then copy
the joplin database from the gui client config folder to the folder here. This
way you don't have to configure it manually in the terminal client (which can
be a pain).
