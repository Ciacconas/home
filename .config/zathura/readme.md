# Zathura

The zathura configuration only two lines for latex synctex. This synctex assumes
you are using neovim_remote, a python package that allows a remote server connection
between an other application and neovim.

furthermore there are a few additions to zathura to make the keyboard shortcuts more
vim-like.
